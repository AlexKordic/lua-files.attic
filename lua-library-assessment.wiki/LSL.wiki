== Overview ==

A "kitchen sink" style library it's a good idea when it is the de facto standard library for a language, which means it has wide availability and acceptance and a stable API, that is, people usually have it installed, know how to use it and are _willing to depend on it_, not only for their applications but also when writing a new library, even a tiny one.

Because Lua has a wider spectrum of usage than other languages, two libs are needed, a fat one for general application development on popular platforms, and a thin one, which is only a small, quickly recognizable vocabulary over the Lua standard library that can be depended on by other libraries and embedded applications. Additionally, a third library to aid development can be added. I call these `kitchensink`, `glue` and `helpers`, respectively. 

== glue == 
_compact assembly of pattern functions based on the Lua standard library_
