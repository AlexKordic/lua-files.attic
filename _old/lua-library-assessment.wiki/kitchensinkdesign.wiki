==== scope ====

  * portabile: lua5.1, lua5.2, luajit2, ansi c, unix, windows, mac
  * horizontaly modular: each library can be compiled and installed separately
  * vertically modular:
    * complete binding layer that can be reused; completeness is both in terms of supported platforms and underlying API coverage
    * dual APIs: simple API for general scripting and prototyping; complete, more complex API when finer control is needed
  *
