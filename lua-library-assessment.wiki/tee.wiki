==`tee([n,]iterator) -> iter1,...,iterN`==

*Return n independent iterators from one iterator.*
  * once the iterator has been split, you can't iterate the original iterator anymore.
  * iterated values are buffered for as much as iterators get out of sync.
  * `n` defaults to 2; passing 1 returns the initial iterator.
  * the name `tee` comes from the unix [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_(command) tee] command.
